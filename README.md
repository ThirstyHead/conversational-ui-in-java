# PRESENTATION: Conversational UIs in Java and Groovy

When was the last time you talked to your Java application? No, not when it threw an unchecked exception -- I mean really, truly talked to your app. When was the last time your Java application talked back to you?

Gartner predicts that 30% of all interactions with computers will be done with your voice by 2018. While most of these conversations will probably be with either your smartphone ("Hello Siri! Hey Google! What's up, Cortana?") or a purpose-built home electronic device ("Hey Alexa!"), why should your Java app be left out of the fun?

In this talk, Scott Davis (author/presenter of the O'Reilly video series "Architecture of the MEAN Stack") helps break down what Conversational UIs are, and how you can adopt them in your application. You'll learn about standards like JSGF (JSpeech Grammer Format) and SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language). You'll also discover open source Java libraries that will help you (and your users) begin to have a meaningful dialog with your application without laying a single finger on a keyboard or mouse.
